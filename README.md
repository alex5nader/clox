# clox

Lox is a programming language created by [Bob Nystrom](https://stuffwithstuff.com/)
for his book, [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/).

This is my implementation of the language, up to Chapter 28 - Methods and Initializers.
I chose to stop my implementation here because my next language will not feature OOP-style
inheritance, and I will revisit optimization once I begin to self-host the compiler.

A full tour of the language is available in
[Chapter 3](http://craftinginterpreters.com/the-lox-language.html) of the book.

(This repo is called clox because the book features two implementations of Lox, first in
Java and then in C).
